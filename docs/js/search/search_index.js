effective coverage of priority interventions at district and community level, covering various intervention such as maternal, newborn, and child health (MNCH), HIV, and nutrition. This process ensures appropriate equity analysis at the sub-national level with the aim of identifying underserved populations and the specific bottlenecks they face in accessing life-saving healthcare. The action tracker is part of the coverage, and bottleneck analysis that utilizes DHIS2’s analytical features to track and assess national and sub-national level performance for purposes of improving health service delivery.\nPrerequisites\n\nNodeJs (10 or higher)\nnpm (6.4.0 or higher), can be installed by running apt install npm\ngit, can be installed by running apt install git\n\nSetup\nClone repository\nbash\n git clone https://github.com/hisptz/action-tracker.git\nNavigate to application root folder\nbash\ncd action-tracker\nInstall all required dependencies for the app\nbash\nnpm install\nDevelopment server\nTo start development server\nnpm start\nNavigate to http://localhost:4200.\nThis command will require proxy-config.json file available in the root of your source code, usually this file has this format\njson\n{\n  \"/api\": {\n    \"target\": \"https://play.dhis2.org/2.29/\",\n    \"secure\": \"false\",\n    \"auth\": \"admin:district\",\n    \"changeOrigin\": \"true\"\n  },\n  \"/\": {\n    \"target\": \"https://play.dhis2.org/2.29/\",\n    \"secure\": \"false\",\n    \"auth\": \"admin:district\",\n    \"changeOrigin\": \"true\"\n  }\n}\nWe have provided proxy-config.example.json file as an example, make a copy and rename to proxy-config.json\nIndex DB Setup\nThis app support index DB as based on dexie library. In order to initiatiate index db then you have to passed index db configuration in forRoot of core module, so in app.module.ts\nts\n........\n@NgModule({\n  declarations: [AppComponent, ...fromPages.pages],\n  imports: [\n   ..........\n    CoreModule.forRoot({\n      namespace: 'iapps',\n      version: 1,\n      models: {\n        users: 'id',\n        dataElement: 'id',\n        .......\n      }\n    })\n    .......\n    ]\n    ......\n    })\nwhere in the models, for example user will be a table \"user\" and 'id' will be a keyIndex for the table\nBuild\nTo build the project run\nnpm run build\nThe build artifacts will be stored in the dist/, this will include a zip file ready for deploying to any DHIS2 instance.\nRunning unit tests\nRun ng test to execute the unit tests via Karma.\nRunning end-to-end tests\nRun ng e2e to execute the end-to-end tests via Protractor.\nFurther help\nTo get more help on the Angular CLI use ng help or go check out the Angular CLI
